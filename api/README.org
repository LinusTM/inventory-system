* Inventory system REST API

** How to start

*** Initialize MariaDB

I would recommend using the shell.nix file in the maria folder.
The file will immediately create a database for you, if it hasn't already been created.

Other wise you may choose to create the database however you'd like.

*** Create the database
At the moment, the REST API expects that the name of your database is "db_testing".
You may create this database by connecting to it over cli, and then using the command "CREATE DATABASE db_testing;".

If you are using the nix-shell, you may connect to the database by simply typing "mysql db_testing".

*** Synchronize the database with the REST API
Use the command "dotnet ef database update", afterwards you may choose to run the database, and it should figure it out.
