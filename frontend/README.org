* Frontend
This is the frontend for the project, which is powered by [[https://kit.svelte.dev][Sveltekit]], [[https://www.typescriptlang.org][Typescript]], and [[https://sass-lang.com][Sass]].

It includes a search page, and an admin page.

** Usage

*** Using nix
Easiest way to make sure that it all runs smoothly, is by using the nix shell, which will
automatically fetch all the packages that are required to run the project.

#+begin_src shell
cd inventory-system/frontend
nix-shell
npm run install
npm run dev
#+end_src

*** Alternative
If you do not have access to nix, then you'll need to fetch the dependencies manually,
and then run the npm commands afterwards.
